  <h4>Requirement</h4>
  <p>
    This code is currently designed to work with Chrome browser only.
    Mozilla Firefox and Opera compatibility should be ready soon.
    What about Internet Explorer and Safari, WebRTC functionalities are simply not supported currently.

    In case you do not get any video from your webcam,
    it is likely to be due to a resolution incompatibility between camera and web browser.
